# CompilerDesign

This is a simple compiler designed in Java for a basic programming language. It includes a scanner, parser, and token classes for lexical analysis and parsing.

## Summary
This compiler project aims to provide a foundational understanding of compiler design concepts by implementing a simple compiler in Java. The project covers key aspects of compiler construction, including lexical analysis (scanning), parsing, and basic syntax checking.

The compiler can tokenize input code, parse it to build a syntax tree, and handle basic control structures like if statements, loops, and arithmetic expressions. It also includes error handling mechanisms to detect syntax errors and infinite loops, ensuring the reliability of the compiled code.

Through this project, developers can gain insights into the inner workings of compilers and deepen their understanding of fundamental programming language concepts.

## Features
-  Lexical analysis (Scanning) to tokenize input code
- Parsing to build a syntax tree
- Support for basic control structures like if, else, for, and while loops
- Arithmetic expressions parsing
- Error handling for syntax errors and infinite loops

## Usage
1. Place your code in a text file (e.g., code.txt) in the project directory.
2. Open **Main.java** and modify the filePath variable to point to your code file.
3. Run **Main.java** to compile and execute your code.

We hope you enjoy exploring the Simple Compiler Design project as much as we enjoyed creating it.
 **Happy coding :)**
